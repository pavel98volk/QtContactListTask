This is a Qt Quick application (build with qmake) that is basically an example of a contacts widget. Contacts are retrieved from file via ContactListProvider. 

<b>THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION, I ONLY FINISHED IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL OF THE TASKS (will add more someday)</b>

0. grid layout: **completed** (pictures-only?)
1. pictures: **completed** (generated from name checksum)
2. search: **completed** (uses regex over full list, therefore disables chunk retrieving)
3. alphabetical jump: **not completed**
4. call: **not completed**
5. chunk retrieving: **completed**
6. favourites: **completed** (saved to local file on change)
7. alphabetical jump: **not completed**
